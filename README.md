For the life of me, I could not get [https://github.com/cgtinker/BlendArMocap](BlendArMocap) running on my Mac. For some reason it would crash the second I clicked "Start Detection".

Ironically, the add-on would work fine if I started direct from the command line. This was not an admin-privileges problem either, but Blender's logging on the Mac is sent to Console and is terrible.

So I threw together something quick that would launch Blender as well as log to somewhere useful.
